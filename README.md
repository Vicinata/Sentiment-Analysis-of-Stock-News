#PROJECT: Stock News Sentiment Analysis v1
This was a fun project, time for more!
I enjoyed this project because of my love of finance and economics. As a child, my parents taught me,time and time again, the importance of saving and investing. 
Therefore, being able to implement sentiment analysis to stock news and visualize their impacts in real time is a great tool to have.
